For this version of GMPbench, there are just 6 parts:

	[Multiply large numbers]
	base.multiply (weight 1)

	[Divide numbers of different sizes]
	base.divide (weight 1)

	[Compute the greatest common divisor]
	base.gcd (weight 0.5)

	[Compute the extended greatest common divisor]
	base.gcdext (weight 0.5)

	[Compute the square root]
	base.sqrt (weight 0.5)

	[Compute the nth root]
	base.root (weight 0.5)

	[Run the RSA encryption algorithm]
	app.rsa (weight 1)

	[Compute digits of Pi]
	app.pi (weight 1)


Result scores are computed as a weighted geometric mean.  Please use the included
script runbench for running the benchmarks and computing benchmark scores.

Guidelines:

  1. If benchmark code is changed, results are invalid and should not be
     reported as GMPbench results.  Compilation parameters may be changed,
     as long as the same parameters are used for all GMP source files and
     for all benchmark files.
  2. If GMP source is changed, results should not be reported as GMPbench
     results unless the following three conditions are met:
     A. It is clearly stated that GMP was changed when reporting results.
     B. The changes are generic and reasonable and not specifically targeted
	towards improving some aspect specifically exercised by the benchmark
	suite.
     C. All rights to the changes are assigned to the Free Software
	Foundation prior to publication of the benchmark results.
  3. As long as these rules are followed, results may be freely used.
     Please also report results to the GMP developer's mailing list
     gmp-devel@swox.com.
  4. When reporting results, this data should be included:
     A. Machine type and model
     B. CPU type and clock frequency
     C. GMP version used
     D. List of modifications as permitted above
     E. Compiler and compiler version used
     F. Compiler options used
  5. The benchmark suite is believed to be compatible with GMP 4.1 or later.
